# Analog Redstone Lamp

Why should redstone lamps only live in a binary world — on or off?  
This mod lets them **glow with nuance**, scaling their **brightness smoothly** with the **redstone signal strength**
they
receive.

A signal of 1 gives a faint pulse, 15 burns bright — finally, your lamps understand subtlety.
